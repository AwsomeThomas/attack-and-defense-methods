The main idea of this paper is quite simple, attaching a detector of adversarial examples with a regular classifier. Something original is that they extended it to a dynamic senerio and proposed dynamic adversary training. 

I do not understand the architechture of their networks.

And The Paper *Detecting adversarial samples from artifacts* pointed out some drawbacks of this work at Section 2.
