## Summary
## Motivation
## Method(s)
## Evaluation
## Conclusion
1. CNN may capture High Frequency Componentthat are misaligned with human visual preference, resulting in generalization mysteries such as the paradox of learning lable-shuffled data and adversarial vulnerability.
2. Heuristics that improve accuracy (Mix-up and BatchNorm) may encourage capturing HFC.
3. Adversarially robust models tend to have smooth convolutional kernels, the reverse is not always true.
