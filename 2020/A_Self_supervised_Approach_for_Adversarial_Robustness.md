## Motivation
- Adversarial training that enhances robustness by modifying target model's parameters lacks generalizability of cross-task protection. 
- Different input processing based defenses fall short in the face of continuously evolving attacks.
- Our defense aims to combine the benefits of adversarial
training and input processing methods in a single frame-
work that is computationally efficient, generalizable across
different tasks and retains the clean image accuracy.
