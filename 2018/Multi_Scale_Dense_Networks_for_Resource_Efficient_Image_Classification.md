There are two reasons why intermediate early-exit classifiers hurt the performance of deep neural networks: **early classifiers lack coarse-level features** and **classifiers throughout interfere with the feature generation process.**

 Empirically, we find that using the same weight for all loss functions (i.e., setting âˆ€k : wk = 1) works well in
practice.
