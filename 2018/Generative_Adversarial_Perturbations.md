This paper investigated methods to generate adversarial perturbations. They classified the perturbations with universal/iamge-dependent, and targeted/untargeted.

Something interesting is that the perturbations converted to a bird-like perturbation when generating universal perturbations. And the targeted universal perturbations contains patterns resembling the target class. **This is the first paper to generate targeted universal perturbations**.

And according to the experiments, teh Resnet Generator introduced in [1] outperforms the U-net.
