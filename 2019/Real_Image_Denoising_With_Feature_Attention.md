## Motivation
Deep convolutional neural networks perform better
on images containing spatially invariant noise (synthetic noise); however, their performance is limited on real-noisy photographs and requires multiple stage network modeling.

## Methods
They use a residual on the residual structure to ease the flow of low-frequency information and apply feature attention to exploit the channel dependencies.
