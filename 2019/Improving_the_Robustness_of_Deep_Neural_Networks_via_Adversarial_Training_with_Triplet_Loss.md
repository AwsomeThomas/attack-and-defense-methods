This paper proposed to incorperate the Tripet Loss into adversarial training. The difference is that they modify the anchor of triplet loss with adversarial examples and examples with different labels in the embedding space.

The second distribution is that they proposed the tripet loss can be formulated as a regularization term with other defense methods.
